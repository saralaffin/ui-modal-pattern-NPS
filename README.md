# User Interface- Modal Pattern using National Parks API

## Getting started
To see the website, click [here](https://saralaffin.github.io/ui-modal-pattern-NPS)

*Modal*

When a user clicks on a link, a box should appear in the center of the screen with the details for the item that the user clicks on. The box should have some way for the user to close the box and see the full list of items.

## Requirements

Each student should pick one UI Pattern and one API and combine the two. The data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API. When the user loads the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the screen.

### Technical Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

- Runs without errors
- Shows the UI pattern you selected populated with data from the API you selected
- Functions according to the descriptions above. The user should be able to interact with your UI.
- Includes a README written in well formatted Markdown (hint: look up a README template)
- Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of small commits.
